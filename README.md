# Transforming Raw Zomato Data Into Actionable Business Insights.

# 🍽️ Zomato Strategic Revenue Performance Analysis
A Data‑Driven Deep Dive Into Restaurant Popularity, Revenue Drivers & Customer Behavior
This project explores 3 years of Zomato restaurant, order, menu, and customer data to uncover what truly drives restaurant success on one of the world’s largest food delivery platforms. Using Power BI, advanced DAX measures, and a clean, relational data model, this analysis transforms raw data into actionable business insights.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to understand why certain restaurants outperform others and identify the key factors influencing revenue, order volume, and cuisine popularity.
This end‑to‑end project includes:
- Data cleaning & transformation in Power Query
- Data modeling across Restaurant, Orders, Menu, and Users tables
- Custom DAX measures for KPIs and performance metrics
- Interactive Power BI dashboards for strategic insights
- A validated business hypothesis backed by real data

📊 Key Insights
- Domino’s Pizza is the top‑earning restaurant with ₹22.3M in revenue.
- North Indian, Indian, and Chinese cuisines dominate both orders and revenue.
- A strong positive correlation exists between order volume and revenue, validating the core hypothesis.
- Missing restaurant IDs (“Blank”) contribute ₹5M in revenue, highlighting a data quality issue.
- Revenue peaked in 2018 before declining in 2019–2020, suggesting market or operational shifts.

🧠 Business Hypothesis (Validated)
Restaurants with higher customer ratings and higher order volume generate the highest revenue.

The analysis confirms that order volume is the strongest predictor of revenue, and top‑performing restaurants are also well‑known brands with strong customer trust—supporting the hypothesis.
